Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.

Ans) Arrays are a fundamental data structure with contiguous memory allocation, allowing constant-time access to elements via indexing. Their advantages include memory efficiency, cache friendliness, simplicity, and support for both static and dynamic sizes, making them suitable for a wide range of applications in computer science.
Advantages of Arrays:-
1)Constant Time Access
2)Memory Efficiency
3)Cache Friendliness
4)Static and Dynamic Variants
5)Simplicity
