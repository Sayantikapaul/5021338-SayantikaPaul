Explain different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).

Ans) Bubble Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Steps:-
1)Compare the first two elements of the array.
2)If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
3)Move to the next pair of elements, and repeat the comparison and swap process.
4)Continue this until the end of the array.
5)Repeat the entire process for the entire array until no swaps are needed.


Insertion Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much like sorting playing cards in your hands, where you take one card at a time and insert it into its correct position.
Steps:-
1)Start with the second element (the first element is considered sorted).
2)Compare the current element with the previous elements and insert it into its correct position.
3)Repeat the process for all elements.


Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. The process is recursively applied to the partitions.
Steps:-
1)Choose a pivot element from the array.
2)Partition the array into two halves: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
3)Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays.


Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
Steps:-
1)Divide the array into two halves.
2)Recursively sort each half.
3)Merge the two halves to produce the sorted array.
