Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.

Ans) Linear search is a simple algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. It does not require the list to be sorted.

Steps:-
1)Start from the first element of the list.
2)Compare the current element with the target element.
3)If the current element matches the target, return the index of the element.
4)If the current element does not match, move to the next element.
5)Repeat steps 2-4 until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
6)If the end of the list is reached without finding the target, return a value indicating that the element is not present.

Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that requires the list to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half.

Steps:-
1)Start with the entire list as the search interval.
2)Find the middle element of the current interval.
3)Compare the middle element with the target element.
4)If the middle element matches the target, return the index of the middle element.
5)If the target element is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half of the current interval.
6)If the target element is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half of the current interval.
7)Repeat steps 2-6 until the target element is found or the search interval is empty.
8)If the search interval becomes empty without finding the target, return a value indicating that the element is not present.
