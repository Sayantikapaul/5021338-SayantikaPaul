Ans) In an e-commerce platform search function, choosing the appropriate search algorithm is crucial for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Linear search and binary search are two common search algorithms, each with distinct characteristics in terms of time complexity for best, average, and worst-case scenarios.

For Linear Search:-

Best Case:
Scenario: The target element is the first element in the list.
Time Complexity: O(1)

Average Case:
Scenario: The target element is somewhere in the middle of the list.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Worst Case:
Scenario: The target element is the last element in the list or not present at all.
Time Complexity: O(n)



For Binary Search:-

Best Case:
Scenario: The target element is the middle element of the array.
Time Complexity: O(1)

Average Case:
Scenario: The target element is in the array but not necessarily in the middle.
Time Complexity: O(log n)

Worst Case:
Scenario: The target element is not in the array, or it is at one of the extremes.
Time Complexity: O(log n)
