Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Ans) Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This technique can simplify the implementation of certain problems, especially those that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Hereâ€™s an explanation of recursion and how it can be used to simplify problem-solving.
Recursion occurs when a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. The recursive function typically includes:
1)Base Case: A condition that stops the recursion. This prevents infinite recursion and allows the function to return a result.
2)Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments, progressively approaching the base case.

Recursion Simplifies Problems such as:
1)Natural Fit for Divide-and-Conquer: Problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems are naturally suited for recursion.
Example: Quicksort and Merge sort are sorting algorithms that use a recursive approach to divide and conquer the problem.


2)Simplifies Code for Complex Problems: Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to understand than their iterative counterparts for certain problems.
Example: Traversing complex data structures like trees and graphs is often simpler with recursion.


3)Elegant and Readable: Recursion can make the code more readable by expressing the problem in a clear and straightforward manner.
Example: The recursive approach to the Fibonacci sequence is more intuitive than an iterative approach.
