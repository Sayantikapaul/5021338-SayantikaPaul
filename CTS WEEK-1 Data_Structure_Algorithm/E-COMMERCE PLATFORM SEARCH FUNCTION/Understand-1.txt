Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Ans) Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in terms of the size of the input data. It provides a high-level understanding of an algorithm's efficiency and helps in comparing the performance of different algorithms.
Performance Prediction: Big O notation helps predict how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows, allowing developers to choose the most efficient algorithm for large data sets.

Comparison of Algorithms: By providing a common framework, Big O notation allows for the comparison of different algorithms in terms of their time and space complexity.

Scalability Analysis: Big O notation helps in understanding the scalability of an algorithm, which is crucial for systems expected to handle large volumes of data.

Algorithm Optimization: It highlights the potential inefficiencies in an algorithm, guiding developers to optimize or choose better algorithms.

Resource Allocation: By understanding the complexity of an algorithm, resource allocation (such as CPU time and memory) can be better managed.
